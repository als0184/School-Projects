# Comp - 5970 Secure Software Construction
**Course Semester Summer 2023**

Welcome to my repository which demonstrates the skills and knowledge I've gained during the Secure Software Construction course. This repository is structured around various assignments, showcasing both manual and automated security testing methodologies, as well as secure coding practices.

**What I Learned:**

    Manual Code Inspection:
        Skills to manually review and identify potential security threats in merge requests.
        Local code refactoring to enhance security and ensure robustness.

    Static Application Security Testing (SAST):
        Integration of SonarQube for static code analysis.
        Addressing and resolving potential security issues detected by the tool.

    Dependency Scanning:
        Recognizing the importance of keeping dependencies updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
        Performing dependency scans and updating dependencies in pom.xml to resolve any identified security threats.

    Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):
        Implementation and execution of DAST for identifying runtime vulnerabilities.

    Secure Deployment:
        Techniques to securely deploy modules to a package registry.

    Web Application Security:
        Ensuring the .war file used in deployment matches specifications.
        Addressing specific security concerns related to web applications, such as port configurations, AWS environment variables, and more.

    Advanced Configurations:
        Mastery in manipulating configuration files (pom.xml, sitemap.xml, .gitlab-ci.yml) to reflect correct project information and dependencies.

    Secure Web Practices:
        Addressing issues like the Content Security Policy (CSP) and understanding the importance of secure headers.

    Pipeline Creation and Management:
        Designing and implementing end-to-end build pipelines with integrated security testing stages.
        Using Git branches effectively for iterative development and fixes.

    Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
        Adopting best CI/CD practices ensuring code changes are automatically tested and deployed securely.

Conclusion:

This repository is a recollection of my efforts in writing secure code and implementing security best practices in software development.
