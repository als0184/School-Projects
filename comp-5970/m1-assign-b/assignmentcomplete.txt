This is simply my documentation of completing this assignment. This is entrily
repetitive and unneeded but it helps me keep track of all I did.
(Side note: The terminal does not spell check so I will more then likly mis
spell alot of words... I am sorry) 

I followed the first part of the assignment where I was able to install both
the proper java version and maven. I then cloned the gitlab repository and was
able to follow along with the general overview and basic commands for Maven.

This accounted for steps 1-10 of the assignments instructions, and since there
was nothing to commit or add to the repository during these steps I submitted
a seperate .txt file and pushed it to the repository. This .txt file was
similar to this but just documented the completion of those steps. 

Following that I then started on the "Modifying the Maven Build" 
In these steps I created a new branch called feature-add and edited the
pom.xml file and added my auburn email as the artifact id. I ran the mvn
package and saw that the id had changed. I then added and commited these
changes.

Next I went into the App class and added a simple method for adding two
integers. Following that I implemted a junit test to the test class. I then
added and commited these changes and ran the mvn compile, mvn test, and mvn
package. This allowed me to see that the test case was passing and had no
comiplation errors.

Finally I pushed the branch to the repository and merged it into main branch.
