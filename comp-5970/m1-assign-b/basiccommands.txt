I ran through the first part of the assignment which was just an overview of
the basic maven commands.... Throughout the process there were no untracked
files and no need for any commits.

I decided just for the sake of documentation I would create this txt file to
say I have completed the first part of the assignment.

I will now add and commit this file.
